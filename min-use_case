1. read/load the signal data (raw and clean data, so no noice)
2. just pass it through the filter, since there is no noice
3. check if the signal reaches or crosses a specified threshold for a specified (min) duration
4. this leads to a command to the protheses, depending on the current position (if open -> cmd:close || if closed -> cmd:open)
5. protheses (real or simulated) perfoms the motion
